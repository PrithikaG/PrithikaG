# 👋 Hi, I’m Prithika G!  

🚀 **Pre-final year B.Tech student at Chennai Institute of Technology**, currently surviving on **coffee, code, and chaos** while pursuing my degree in **Artificial Intelligence and Data Science**.  

## 👀 About Me  
- 🔥 Passionate about **coding, problem-solving, and breaking things just to fix them again**  
- 🤖 AI enthusiast who believes that **one day my code will write itself (but not today 😭)**  
- 🏗️ Full-stack developer who sometimes spends more time choosing font styles than writing actual code  
- 🐞 Debugging expert (because I write a lot of bugs myself)  
- 💡 Constantly learning, because **the moment you stop, you turn into a legacy system**  

## 💻 What I Do  
- 🎭 Built **Lexicon Lens: AI Powered Text Detection**, because why should humans have all the reading fun?  
- 🛍️ Created **Mirror: Virtual Try-On**, so you can try clothes without actually wearing them (lazy fashion FTW)  
- 🎟️ Developed a **movie ticket booking system**, because nobody likes standing in queues anymore  
- 🏆 Worked on a **leaderboard-based web app**, where **points matter more than real-life achievements**  
- 📱 **Flutter Developer** (Yes, I love making apps, but Flutter sometimes flutters my patience)  
- 🎨 UI/UX geek who thinks **Figma is modern-day magic**  

## 🌱 Currently Learning  
- ☁️ **Cloud Computing & AWS** (because apparently, everything has to live in the cloud now)  
- 🐳 **Docker & DevOps** (so my projects don’t crash when I say “It works on my machine!”)  
- 🧠 **Advanced AI & Deep Learning** (trying to make my AI model smarter than me)  
- 💼 **Freelancing & startup development**, because being broke is not fun  

## 💡 Looking to Collaborate On  
- 🤖 **AI & ML projects** (If it involves neural networks, I’m in!)  
- 🌍 **Full-stack web and mobile app development** (Frontend, Backend… I do it all)  
- 🛠 **Open-source contributions** (because sharing is caring… and good for the resume 😆)
